In this I created a working chatbot using API key and then used streamlite to develop a basic front-end GUI.

## Remember to use your API key I changed the API key in the code

I created multi page to sign-in and login and also the answer will be provided when the button enter is pressed.

Then the new text box will be provided to ask question when clear button is pressed.

I used the basic methods from the streamlit like
  - title
  - columns
  - markdown
  - session_state
  - text_input
  - rerun
  - write

There was a configuration of api and then the response is given through the markdown format in the front end.
