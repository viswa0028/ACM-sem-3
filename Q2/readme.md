In the code I created a linear regression model from scratch.

There are two functions 
 - fit
 - Predict

Both the functions are used to create a model and then are applied to the csv file of salary v/s work expirience

When compared with the library it is mostly similar but when there is a larger file then it might decrease the efficiency,
