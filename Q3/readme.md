In this question I created a deep neural networking with 3 hidden layers to find the customer churn prediction.

Firstly I preprocessed the dataset .

I used different activation functions like
  - relu
  - sigmoid
to create a deep neural network with adam optimizer and loss function.

Finally found a fully functioning neural network with high accuracy and also the loss function is found at each epochs.
