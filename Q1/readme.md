In the above code I used unsupervised learning to classify the iris dataset(csv) .

I used scikit learn libraries like 
  
  - Kmeans
  - classification report

I also created a scatter plot to provide the information about the clusters and also to find the end results  after the clustering

The classification report is used to provide the information about the accuracy of the model and also the precision and other things.
